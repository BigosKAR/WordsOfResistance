    <h1>PROFITS over LIVES</h1>
    <p>The NRA has a lot of supporters, many of which are gun companies. They are part of the Golden Ring of Freedom, which consists of companies that donated at least 1 million dollars to the NRA. Gun companies supporting the NRA get invited to private events hosted by the organization. During these events, companies can discuss their interests with the NRA. In that case, when talking about banning weapons of any sort, it would be unprofitable for the NRA to compromise with the other side because that would lead to less profits for them and the gun companies. That makes it impossible to debate and reason with the NRA.</p>

    <h1>Former CEO in a corruption trial</h1>
    <p>The former CEO of the NRA, alongside two other executives, has recently been found liable for misspending millions of NRA's dollars. It has been said that LaPierre has caused 5.6 million dollars in harm to the NRA. According to the attorneys for the New York attorney general's office, LaPierre used the money on private flights and trips to the Bahamas over the span of three years.</p>

    <h1>NRA's ties with Russia</h1>
    <p>In December 2015, NRA traveled to Moscow. The trip was coordinated by Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin, who are both Russian. Maria has served a prison sentence for trying to infiltrate US conservative groups. The FBI said that she plotted to use the NRA to ultimately influence US gun policy in favor of Russia. Top NRA officials traveled there for personal business purposes while being a non-profit organization. That meant a violation of the rule that tax-exempt resources can not be used for personal gain.</p>

    <p class="container_text_footer">The National Rifle Association claims to be America's longest-standing civil rights organization.
      However, its actions often prioritize the interests of the gun industry over public safety. 
      Despite boasting more than five million members, the NRA's staunch defense of firearms disregards the rights of countless individuals affected by gun violence.
      Rather than being diligent protectors of the Second Amendment, 
      the NRA's uncompromising stance impedes sensible gun regulation and contributes to the epidemic of gun-related deaths and injuries in the United States.</p>
