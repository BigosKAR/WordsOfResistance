    <h1>PROFITS over LIVES</h1>
    <p>The NRA has a lot of supporters, many of which are gun companies. They are part of the Golden Ring of Freedom, which consists of companies that donated at least 1 million dollars to the NRA. Gun companies supporting the NRA get invited to private events hosted by the organization. During these events, companies can discuss their interests with the NRA. In that case, when talking about banning weapons of any sort, it would be unprofitable for the NRA to compromise with the other side because that would lead to less profits for them and the gun companies. That makes it impossible to debate and reason with the NRA.</p>

    <h1>Former CEO in a corruption trial</h1>
    <p>The former CEO of the NRA, alongside two other executives, has recently been found liable for misspending millions of NRA's dollars. It has been said that LaPierre has caused 5.6 million dollars in harm to the NRA. According to the attorneys for the New York attorney general's office, LaPierre used millions of dollars on private flights and trips to the Bahamas over the span of three years.</p>

    <h1>NRA's ties with Russia</h1>
    <p>In December 2015, NRA traveled to Moscow. The trip was coordinated by Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin, who are both Russian. Maria has served a prison sentence for trying to infiltrate US conservative groups. The FBI said that she plotted to use the NRA to ultimately influence US gun policy in favor of Russia. Top NRA officials traveled there for personal business purposes while being a non-profit organization. That meant a violation of the rule that tax-exempt resources can not be used for personal gain.</p>

    <div class="manifesto_text">
      <p>Gun violence has been a problem in the US for a very long time. Numerous bills have been passed that did not fix the problem. One of the biggest issues is the mass shootings. Every time one occurs, there is a discussion about gun safety in the USA. One side says that it is crucial to get rid of weapons while others use these tragedies to say that they are the reason why people need guns to defend themselves. The USA leads when it comes to homicide and mass shooting rates. One of the organizations that is not helping to fix this problem is the NRA.</p>      
      <p>The NRA was started in 1871 to teach men how to shoot better. Later they started promoting shooting as a sport at colleges and they even organized summer camps for young people. They later started getting involved in politics. They tried to limit the effect of the bans that occurred in the 20th century. They also sold guns through their magazine. In a 2001 survey, lawmakers decided that the NRA was the most influential lobbying group in America.</p>
      <p>Debating with the NRA nowadays is proven to be useless. They are profiting off gun companies that donate to them. For example, Taurus was offering free yearly NRA memberships for people who bought their firearms. In 2015, Ruger decided to donate 2$ to the NRA for every gun sold. The NRA is making money from them, so any new law that would limit gun usage would also limit their profit. In debates, they do not care about protecting human lives but about protecting guns because that is how they make money. The NRA also hosts events for the companies that support them so it is very probable that they act on behalf of the gun industry. When it comes to public safety, greed, and private connections should not be deciding factors. We must ensure a safe environment for the people living in the USA. The NRA also worked with Russians. One of them was Maria Butina, who was later sentenced to prison for being a spy and trying to influence the US gun policy in favor of Russia. An organization that has a lot of influence in whether or not new bills regarding gun control pass, definitely should not work with people who have links to the government of another country. That can be very dangerous for the US citizens. The NRA also went there for personal business interests, which in itself is questionable because it categorizes itself as a non-profit organization. That is another example of how greed controls them. The former CEO of the NRA was also caught for spending millions of dollars on his lavish lifestyle. He used the money of people and companies that support the values of the NRA to fund private flights and tropical vacations. That is yet another example of their greed. An organization that cares about the safety of the people would not act this way.</p>
      <p>We mustn't take the NRA's opinion when it comes to new gun laws because now we know what their true intentions are. A better solution would be a new NRA alternative that does not take money from gun companies, which may influence the organization. The new group should focus on balancing the Second Amendment with the safety of the US citizens. That way we can ensure a better and, hopefully, safer future for everyone in the country. What we can do as ordinary people is inform others about the unethical practices of the NRA and how they negatively affect the safety of the USA.</p>

    <p class="container_text_footer">On the official NRA website, we can see that the NRA considers themselves America's longest-standing civil rights organization. However, they act on behalf of the gun industry by taking donations from gun companies and organizing special events for their supporters. All of their unethical practices make it impossible to provide a safe environment for US citizens.
